I have been working with the UCL Transport Insitute in building them a search
facility for finding experts in the transport field. The application integrates
with a CRM to list experts and allows filtering by their expertise. The detail
view for each expert then shows selected academic information along with a widget of their full acadmeic background. The data is currently incomplete as the entry of data into the CRM is still in development so the data is not fully populated but the institue are hoping
to get this live soon. The applicaton is built using <strong>AngularJS</strong>
which uses the style guide written by <a
